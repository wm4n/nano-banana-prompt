```text
Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene of [CITY], featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural elements. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly into the city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.
Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.

At the top-center, place the title “[CITY]” in large bold text, a prominent weather icon beneath it, then the date (small text) and temperature (medium text).
All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the tops of the buildings.
Square 1080x1080 dimension.

```text
 Present a clear 45° top-down view of a vertical (9:16) isometric miniature 3D cartoon city scene. Highlight iconic landmarks centered in the composition to show precise, delicate modeling. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials, gentle lifelike lighting, and smooth shadow effects. Integrate weather elements naturally into the urban architecture so the city’s landscape and atmosphere feel connected.

Create an immersive weather vibe with a clean, unified, minimalistic layout. Use a soft, solid-colored background that makes the main content pop and keeps the whole visual fresh and soothing. Place a prominent weather icon at the top center. Beneath it, include the date in extra-small text and the temperature range in medium-sized text. The city name Auckland appears in large text directly above the weather icon.

Make sure the weather info has no background and can subtly overlap with the buildings. All text should match the native language of the selected city. Retrieve the current real-world weather conditions for that city before rendering.

### 4. Lecturer's Whiteboard

```
A university professor's whiteboard filled with complex handwritten notes. The whiteboard visually explains core ideas using various charts, connecting arrows, boxes, and explanatory text. All handwriting is in [English] and uses multi-colored markers (e.g., black, red, blue, green) to differentiate concepts. The content visualized on the board is a structured breakdown of the following text:
[All text that you want to explain e.g.
Let the two brothers handle the cake cutting and selection themselves. The older brother cuts, and the younger brother gets first pick. This ensures both feel the outcome is fair.
However, what if there are three siblings involved? How can the cake be distributed fairly in that case?
Actually, the solution still relies on the "you cut, I choose" method. First, the older brother cuts the cake, and the younger brother chooses his half, ensuring the initial split is fair. Next, both brothers cut their own portions into three pieces. Then, the sister is asked to pick one piece from each brother's set. This way, each of the three siblings ends up with two out of the six total pieces.]
